A man who sold brooms went into a barber's shop to get shaved.
 The barber brought one of his brooms.
  After he had shaved him, he asked for the price of the brooms. 
"Two pence," said the man. 
"No, no," said the barber. 
"I will give you a penny, and if you don't think that is enough, you may take your broom back!" 
The man took it and asked what he had to pay his shave. 
"A penny," said the barber. 
"I will give you a half penny, and if that is not enough, you may put my beard on again."
